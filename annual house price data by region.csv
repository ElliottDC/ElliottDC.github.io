Notes:,,,,,,,,,,
1,Data up to and including 2002 are from 5% sample. Data from 2003 are based on a significantly enhanced sample size. Data from September 2005 are collected via the Regulated Mortgage Survey. 2005 data are based on combined data from the Survey of Mortgage Lenders and the Regulated Mortgage Survey.,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
2,Simple averages are more volatile to changes in the structure of the underlying data than mix-adjusted averages.,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
3,The data published in these tables are based on a sub-sample of RMS data. These results will therefore differ from results produced using full sample data.  For further information please contact the ONS using the contact details below.,,,,,,,,,
