            <p>Housing is often the biggest single purchase an individual will make in their lifetime, even individuals who do not wish to own property will most likely have to pay some sort of rental expenditure in order to maintain a roof over their heads. Because of this housing is of great importance to all rational actors in an economy.  Furthermore, the housing market is tightly linked to consumer spending as price changes effect homeowners’ confidence and therefore spending in an economy. House prices change for many reasons, some of which include, overall housing stock in an economy, Mortgage rates available for potential buyers and buyers sentiment which can propagate bubbles or pop them. This project aims at exploring the UK’s housing market, focusing on price changes and trends over recent years across the whole of the UK, looking at some potential causes of these price changes and then focusing on the prospects for the future of the housing market.</p>

            The main challenge with this data was the cleaning needed due to layout of the data in the csv shown in this <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1xyQywADmqA5_aOHMANhrZHKQpdCpAC0j">Colab notebook</a> using pandas.

            <p> This chart focuses on London home prices as they are an outlier to the overall data. 
                This data came with some obsticles. Firstly, mapping the Borough Names for the Geojson to the Borough names in the
                 <a href="https://github.com/ElliottDC/ElliottDC.github.io/blob/main/WideLondonSplitdate4.csv">CSV</a>. required some manual search and replace for the '&' 
                 signs. Secondly in order to allow the param command to be functional, the date component needed to be split and put into a format vega-lite could read. This was done using pandas in google colab, shown
