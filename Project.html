        <p>Housing is often the biggest single purchase an individual will make in their lifetime, 
            even individuals who do not wish to own property will most likely have to pay rent
            in order to maintain a roof over their heads at some point. Because of this housing is of great importance 
            to all rational actors in an economy.  Furthermore, the housing market is tightly linked to consumer spending 
            as price changes effect homeowners’ confidence and therefore spending in an economy. House prices change for many 
            reasons, some of which include; changes in the overall housing stock in an economy, Mortgage rates available for potential buyers 
            and buyers sentiment which can propagate bubbles or pop them. This project aims at exploring the UK’s housing market, 
            focusing on price changes and trends over recent years across the whole of the UK, looking at some potential causes of 
            these price changes and then focusing on the prospects for the future of the housing market.</p>

            <p> This chart focuses on London home as they are a particularly  example of how inflated house prices are becoming. 
                This data came with some obstacles. Firstly, mapping the Borough Names for the Geojson to the Borough names in the
                 <a href="https://github.com/ElliottDC/ElliottDC.github.io/blob/main/WideLondonSplitdate4.csv">CSV</a>. required some manual search and replace for the '&' 
                 signs. Secondly in order to allow the param command to be functional, the date component needed to be split and put into a format vega-lite could read. This was done using pandas in google colab, shown

                and what looks like is about to come in the years after 2021 in which the data ends. This regression was done in vega-lite using the 'Transform' and 'regression' commands.

            </div>
            <div class="textbox1">
                <p>Regions across the entire United Kingdom have seen house prices grow exponentially over the years, with acceptions of being the recession of the early 
                    1990s and the housing market crash of 2008. This growth in prices is a result of many things, including population growth and the chaneg in composition 
                    of housing within the uk. 
                    so what is to come?
                    Given the current state of the UK economy with recession on the horizon, it would be rational to conclude that house prices are due for a correction. Which is the case 


                    
                    However, nonetheless housing in the United Kingdom has proven to be a steadily growing and resiliant investment.   </p>
